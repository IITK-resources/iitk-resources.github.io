The course content is divided into two parts. The first half consists of Organic Chemistry concepts, many of which are repititions of those that we studied during our JEE preparation. The second half consists of Physical Chemistry.

The course focusses on aspects involved in general software development. In the first half, it is shown how important proper documentation and collaboration amongst team members is, as well as how to cater to the needs of the software properly. The second part of the course focusses more on the programming aspect of software development. It includes Object oriented programming (Classes &amp;amp; Objects) in C++ language, usage of bash script for Unix-based OS, and python programming for modern applications.</description></item><item><title>CS641A</title><link>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/cs641a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/cs641a/</guid><description>This is a quite popular course among 3rd year and 4th year students, and even a lot of 2nd year students do this course but it would be difficult for them. This course focusses on classical and modern technique of cryptology and the process of decryption for decryptable techniques. The assignments, to be solved in teams of 3, consistute the major part of the course. Though the assignments are mostly repeated hence you can easily find hints/solutions over the interent and you can proceed accordingly.</description></item><item><title>CS771A</title><link>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/cs771a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/cs771a/</guid><description>This course will be an introduction to the design (and some analysis) of Machine Learning algorithms, with a modern outlook, focusing on the recent advances, and examples of real-world applications of Machine Learning algorithms. This is supposed to be the first (&amp;ldquo;intro&amp;rdquo;) course in Machine Learning. No prior exposure to Machine Learning will be assumed. At the same time, please be aware that this is NOT a course about toolkits/software/APIs used in applications of Machine Learning, but rather on the principles and foundations of Machine Learning algorithms, delving deeper to understand what goes on &amp;ldquo;under the hood&amp;rdquo;, and how Machine Learning problems are formulated and solved.</description></item><item><title>EE200A</title><link>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee200a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee200a/</guid><description>This introductory course is the first core course to be done by all students under Electrical Engineering branch.
The course content is very straight-forward and easy. There are some conventions and definitions to be understood (not rememebered) and the most important and the only major topic is the Laplace Transform. Till Midsem, analog signals are covered while after midsem, digitals signals are taught but all concepts taught in the second half are almost same as the first half, the only difference being that they are applied on digital/discrete signals instead of analog signals.</description></item><item><title>EE210A</title><link>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee210a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee210a/</guid><description>This course is a DC course, to be done in the 4th semester by the Electrical Engineering branch.
This course is the first course which will give you the feeling of what a specialisation in core electrical might look like. The course content includes discussions on diodes, BJTs and MOSFETs in the beginning, and then the complex structures, like amplifiers and output stages, are presented to you. Amplifier is the most element so make sure that you understand its properties.</description></item><item><title>EE250A</title><link>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee250a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee250a/</guid><description>This course is a DC course, to be done in the 4th semester by the Electrical Engineering branch.
This course introduces you to a specific field of core electrical engineering, namely control systems, which have profound usgae in almost all controlled machinery like robotics. This course is somparatively easy than other core courses. Laplace transform, taught in EE200A - Signals, Systems and Networks, is the only mathematical tool used for almost all tasks in this course.</description></item><item><title>EE320A</title><link>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee320a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee320a/</guid><description>This is a DC course to be done by all Electrial Engineering Students in the 5th semester.
The course content is somewhat a continuation of EE200A - Signals, Systems and Networks course. The fourier transform plays an important role in the representation of signals. A large part of the course focusses on different kinds of Modulation and their properties. These modulation techniques are later used to analyse and remove noise from a system.</description></item><item><title>EE330A</title><link>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee330a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iitk-resources.github.io/courses/ee330a/</guid><description>This is a DC course to be done by all Electrial Engineering Students in the 5th semester.
The course content is somewhat a continuation of ESO203A - Introduction to Electrical Engineering course. The first few lectures cover the basic circuit principles like Three Phase Systems and Per Unit analysis. Then the discussion advances to topics like Transmission Line paramteres and models. They are used to conduct Power Flow Analysis using self-consistent methods.</description></item></channel></rss>
